= saddle-pool-stats

== Usage

```lang=bash
cp .env-dev .env
```

Ask for a team member for missing fields in your .env. You will need to create
a new API key on https://app.fleek.co/[Fleek] and use the values for
`FLEEK_KEY_ID` and `FLEEK_KEY`.

Once you fill in the variables:

```lang=bash
pipenv install
pipenv run python3 calc_apy_and_volume.py
```

Delete the `pool-stats-dev.json` on Fleek as necessary for your development.

== Production

This script runs periodically as a Github action.
